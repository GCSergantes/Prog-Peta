     Before there was the Super Nintendo, there was the Super Famicom. The console initially launched in Japan on November 21, 1990 for 25,000 Yen. Nintendo kept the same casing when it released the console in Europe and Australia. The Super Famicom featured more rounded corners than its subsequent North American variant and featured dark gray hues.

  The system also supported the Satellaview, a satellite modem players could attach to the console to download a limited assortment of games.

    <h2>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</h2>
    
    <p>
      Nintendo released its Western variant of the Super Famicom in North America on August 23, 1991 and rebranded it the Super Nintendo. The underlying specs were the same, and the SNES launched for $199.99. It didn’t sell quite as well as the NES worldwide, but it gained traction in Europe, where its predecessor wasn’t widely available. Overall, the system became the best-selling console of its generation and moved 49.1 million units.
<br>
<br>
Aesthetically, the SNES used a predominantly gray, boxy design. Its purple sliding power and reset switches did give it a toy-like flair, however. The console also had a cartridge-eject button.
<br>
<br>
Underneath the chassis, the system used a Ricoh 5A22 CPU clocked at 3.58MHz. The modest processor was powerful enough to simulate 3D effects with Nintendo’s Mode 7 graphics system, which allowed the background layer of games to be rotated and scaled on a scanline-by-scanline basis. The processor also allowed the system to produce up to 32,768 colors. For audio, Nintendo used an S-SMP audio processing unit, which provided up to eight audio channels. Compared to the NES before it, the SNES used more advanced cartridges that could store up to 120Mb of data.
<br>
<br>
The SNES traded in the rectangular design of the NES controller for one with rounder edges. It also had X and Y face buttons and a pair of shoulder buttons.

    <h2>
      Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Model SNS-101)
    </h2>
    
    <p>Released in North America on October 20, 1997, the revamped SNS-101 version of the Super Nintendo retailed for $99.95. It was designed by Nintendo to be a cheaper, more entry-level gaming system for those who weren’t ready to pay $199.99 for an N64.
    <br>
    <br>
The SNS-101 model was lighter and more compact than the original SNES and combined the specs into a singular system-on-a-chip (SOC) design. The Power and Reset buttons were also moved to the left, and Nintendo removed the cartridge-eject button along with S-Video support.</p>
