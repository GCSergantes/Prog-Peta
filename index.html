    <h3>&nbsp;A Nintendo console retrospective
   </h3>
   <br>
   <p>&nbsp;As one of the most tenured games and entertainment companies, Nintendo has quite a history. It started as a humble playing-card &nbsp;  &nbsp;company in the late 1800s but ended up saving the video game industry from a financial crash in the early 1980s. Since then, Nintendo &nbsp;  &nbsp;has had an illustrious history and has gone on to become arguably the most important console manufacturer of all time. Below you can &nbsp;  &nbsp;find details on the companyâ€™s console hardware highlights.
  <br>
  <br>
    <p>&nbsp;With the announcement of the Switch OLED model, Nintendo's extensive library of consoles and hardware revisions continues to grow. The company has long been known for releasing multiple versions of its hardware platforms, particularly the best-selling ones. Switch has only continued that trend, and the list may even expand further in the near future, as the OLED-equipped Switch could turn out to be separate from rumors of a new, more powerful Switch model. However, Nintendo continues to deny commenting on such a model, instead saying that it's always developing new hardware.</p>
