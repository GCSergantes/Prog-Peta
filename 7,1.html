Piggybacking on top of the Wii’s success, Nintendo launched its Wii U console on November 18, 2012. The name confused many, however, as some people mistakenly took it to be an add-on for the Wii. The console has sold 13.3 million units, which makes it Nintendo’s lowest-selling major console to date.

The white base model of the Wii U launched for $299.99 and came with 8GB of storage, but there was also a Deluxe black version that came with 32GB of storage and included a sensor bar. Like the Wii before it, the Wii U wasn’t a graphical powerhouse, but it was the first Nintendo system to support 1080p.

<br>
The system’s specs were co-developed by Nintendo, AMD, IBM, and Renesas. The Wii U featured IBM’s Espresso CPU clocked at 1.24GHz, and it was coupled by 2GB of DDR3 RAM. For graphics, AMD developed its Latte GPU clocked at 550MHz. The console is also backward-compatible with the Wii.

<br>
Internal tech specs aside, arguably the most significant feature of the Wii U was its GamePad. The tablet-like controller featured a 6.2-inch resistive touchscreen along with dual analog sticks, a D-pad, and several face buttons. The GamePad also supported motion controls, haptic feedback, and near-field communication--a feature that allowed users to sync Nintendo’s Amiibo figures to the console.
<br>
<br>
The touchscreen could be used in a number of ways. Developers could use it to supplement action on the TV screen to create asymmetrical gameplay, for example. The system launched with Nintendo Land, which showcased some of these mechanics. The GamePad could also serve as a second screen for multiplayer games. The Wii U also allowed users to stream games from the console to the GamePad, provided they were within range of each other.

<br>
While the Wii U was compatible with the Wii’s peripherals, Nintendo also released the Pro Controller alongside the system.
