    <p>In 1983, Nintendo released its Family Computer--or Famicom for short--in Japan for 14,800 Yen. In North America, it would receive a significant redesign and later be known as the Nintendo Entertainment System.
<br/><br>
The Famicom was an 8-bit console, and its specs included a Ricoh 2A03 processor coupled with 2KB of RAM. This allowed the system to output a 256x240 resolution display and produce 48 colors along with six gray variations.
<br><br>
On the audio front, the Famicom offered extra sound channels compared to its subsequent Nintendo Entertainment System counterpart. It also supported cartridges with custom sound processors, unlike the NES. Games like Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse had different soundtracks between regions as a result.
<br>
<br>
The Famicom used a top-loading cartridge design with games that scaled from 8KB to 1MB. The system also supported two controllers and had grooves on both sides that allowed players to store the controllers when they weren’t in use. The rectangular controllers themselves featured a D-pad, two face buttons, along with Start and Select buttons and were inspired by the design of Nintendo’s earlier portable Game & Watch handheld systems. The player 2 controller had a built-in microphone that was used in a handful of games, including the original Legend of Zelda.

    <h2>Family Computer Disk System</h2>

    <p>
      On February 21, 1986, Nintendo released an add-on peripheral for the Famicom called the Family Computer Disk System. It supported proprietary 2.8x3-inch floppy disks Nintendo called "Disk Cards." For an add-on, the device was a commercial success and sold 4.44 million units until Nintendo ceased production in 2003.
<br/>
<br>
The Disk System had a RAM adapter that plugged into the Famicom's cartridge slot. Users then needed to connect its cable into the back of the Disk Drive and plug in the included AC adapter. The Disk System also supported six C-cell batteries as an alternative power source.
<br>
<br/>
The add-on had built-in audio hardware that was capable of FM synthesis, which allowed the system to create more complex waveforms that sounded grittier.
<br>
<br>
Disks could hold up to 112KB of data, but many games required users to switch the disks over to access the medium's full storage capacity. Some games also required two disks. The medium allowed users to save game states and rewrite their games at stands in convenient stores for less cost than full-priced cartridges. Disk Card games themselves were also cheaper than their cartridge counterparts.

    <p>
      The Famicom ultimately released in the United States as the Nintendo Entertainment System on October 18, 1985, with a starting price of $299.99. It was Nintendo’s first home console to release outside of Japan.
<br>
<br>
The NES eventually helped pull the North American video game industry out of a two-year crash and was a big success. The system sold more than 61.9 million units, making it the best-selling console of its generation.
<br>
<br>
The NES used a new chassis that differed from its Japanese counterpart. The latter featured a “zero insertion force” cartridge slot coupled with a flip-up door. The problem was that the pins from the system’s internal connector got bent after repeated use. The slot was also very susceptible to dust. These issues prevented many games from properly booting over time. Many users blew into their cartridges in an attempt to mitigate the problem, but this actually tarnished the copper connectors and worsened the issue.
<br>
<br>
Aesthetically, the NES used a predominantly two-toned gray-and-black color scheme but featured red accents on the console and controller.

      Nintendo released a smaller version of the NES in 1993 for $49.99. It used the same Ricoh 2A03 processor as the original console but was less boxy and featured a top-loading cartridge slot, which addressed the insertion issues of the original system.
<br>
<br>
The Model NES-101 was an RF-only system and removed the original system’s power LED light and RCA composite ports. It also introduced an SNES-inspired controller that used rounder edges.
