      Nintendo released its Wii console on November 19, 2006, for $249.99. With it, Nintendo popularized motion controls with its Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers. The Bluetooth peripherals detected movement in three dimensions using built-in accelerometers coupled with an infrared detection sensor. The Wii Remote offered a D-pad, speaker, and few face buttons, along with a trigger button. The Nunchuck offered a control stick and two analog triggers.

Wii Sports was praised as a great showpiece for Nintendo’s motion controllers, and outside Japan, the game was bundled with the system.
<br>
<br>
The console was codenamed Revolution, which appropriately signaled a new design philosophy for Nintendo. The company believed that there wasn’t enough room for three consoles vying for top-tier processing power, so Nintendo attempted to cast a wider net and marketed the Wii toward a more casual audience. The new strategy paid off, and the Wii became a colossal sales success. Not only did Nintendo buck its downward console trend, but it sold more than 101 million units worldwide, making it Nintendo’s best-selling console to date.

<br>
The Wii featured an illuminated slot-loading optical drive. The system also had an SD card slot and 512MB of internal storage. Compared to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, it was far from a technical powerhouse with its IBM PowerPC Broadway CPU and 88MB of memory. Its ATI Hollywood GPU also wasn’t very powerful and relegated the system to 480p.
<br>
<br>
It was Nintendo’s first console to support backwards compatibility. It had four controller ports hidden under a plastic door and supported GameCube games, though later Wii revisions removed this feature.
<br>
<br>
With the system, Nintendo introduced its Virtual Console, which allowed players to download emulated games from past Nintendo consoles. The Wii also featured WiiConnect24, a standby mode that allowed updates over the Internet.
<br>
<br>
In 2007, Nintendo introduced the Wii Balance Board. Designed with exercise games in mind, the peripheral was a great success and sold 42 million units.
<br>

      Shortly after Nintendo released the Wii U, the company released the Wii Mini. Taking a cue from its SNS-101 SNES refresh, the Wii Mini was a redesigned version of the Wii meant to be a more affordable console option to the Wii U. It debuted in Canada on December 7, 2012 for $99.99 and later released in Europe and the United States.
    <br>
    <br>
The Wii Mini featured a smaller redesigned chassis that incorporated a top-loading optical drive. It also removed several features, including S-Video, GameCube compatibility, online connectivity, the SD card slot, Wi-Fi support, and a USB port.
