    <p>
The Nintendo Switch released on March 3, 2017 for $299.99. Like with the Wii before it, the Switch represents a starkly different design path for the company. So far, Nintendo's gamble has paid off.
<br>
<br>
The system is equipped with Nvidia's custom Tegra mobile system-on-a-chip, which is noticeably weaker than the competing Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but its hybrid form factor allows players to not only play it on their TVs, but to game with it on the go.
<br>
<br>
The Switch uses a 6.2 inch 1280x720p touchscreen that offers a modest 236.87 pixel per inch (PPI density). Unlike the Wii U before it, the Switch uses a capacitive panel, which offers a higher contrast ratio and improved gesture support compared to the Wii U's resistive equivalent.
<br>
<br>
The 6.7x3.9x.6 inch tablet form factor is coupled with two Joy-Con motion controllers that offer what Nintendo calls "HD rumble." With its high-fidelity haptic motors, the controllers are able to accurately simulate virtual marbles rolling inside the Joy-Cons, as is evident in the game 1-2-Switch. The right Joy-Con also supports NFC, which users can use to scan Amiibo.
<br>
<br>
The system comes with 32GB of internal storage, but also supports expandable memory up to 2TB via Micro SDXC cards. In terms of battery, the Switch is equipped with a 4,310 mAh lithium-ion cell, which offers roughly three hours of consistent play.
<br>
<br>
While the Wii U was a colossal sales disappointment for Nintendo, the Switch managed to sell over 14.8 million units thus far, beating its predecessor by over a million units in just 10 months. The console was also notoriously hard to find on store shelves in the months after its release. Its sales were bolstered by critically-acclaimed games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and more.
<br>
<br>
Competes against: Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4
<br>
<br>
Notable games: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, Super Mario Maker 2

    <h2>Switch Lite</h2>
    </center>
    
    <img src="lite.jpg" height="250" width="370"/>
    
    <p>
      The Switch Lite released on September 20, 2019. Priced at $199.99, the redesign exclusively focuses on portable play and removes the ability to play on a TV entirely. It's also a tad smaller than the first Switch, shrinking the screen size down from 6.2 inches to 5.5 inches.
<br>
<br>
To accommodate for the new size and cheaper price tag, some of the original Switch's features were removed from the Switch Lite. Aside from not being able to display on a TV, it no longer has detachable Joy-Con controllers. Furthermore, the IR motion sensors and HD Rumble functionality have been removed. Though, you're still able to connect Joy-Con controllers to the Switch Lite.
<br>
<br>
The removal of these features means that a few existing games will no longer be compatible with the Switch Lite. For example, both Mario Party and 1-2 Switch are games that require Joy-Cons to be removed to properly play. In addition, Nintendo Labo, which allows users to build peripherals using cardboard, won't work since the Switch Lite is smaller.
<br>
<br>
As of writing, it comes in three colors: grey, yellow, turquoise, blue, and coral. A fancier limited edition off-white Pokemon-themed one was also released around the time of Pokemon Sword / Shield's release.

  <h2>Switch OLED</h2>

  <p>
    The Switch OLED model is the latest version of Nintendo's hybrid console handheld. Scheduled to release on October 8 at a price point of $349.99, this new model sports a few key differences from previous iterations. As its namesake implies, the upcoming Switch revision has an OLED screen, allowing for a more vivid image. It's also worth noting that the screen is a bit larger than that of the standard Switch model, measuring at 7 inches instead of the previous model's 6.2 inches.
  <br>
  <br> 
Alongside the OLED screen are new speakers that provide enhanced audio--though the exact specs are still unknown. Regardless, we can assume that the enhanced audio is likely to give the Switch a boost to sound clarity and overall audio levels.
  <br>
  <br>
The Switch OLED alleviates a few of the major criticisms of the original model's physical functionality, featuring a wider, adjustable kickstand to give the console more leverage when setting it up on a table. In addition, the console's updated dock now has a wired LAN port, which is a welcome change from the previous dock's need for a USB attachment to unlock such functionality.
  <br>
  <br>
Aside from the outlined physical changes and an expanded storage capacity of 64 GB, the internal architecture powering the Switch OLED is virtually identical to the current models in the market, so don't expect any boosts to game performance or battery life. For Nintendo, the Switch OLED model seems to represent a bit of a stopgap between the current model and a potentially more powerful version of the console. Rumors have been circulating for months about the possibility of a beefed-up revision; several of the Switch OLED's features even align with the proposed improvements being made to the rumored console upgrade. However, time will tell if another Switch model is on the way.
