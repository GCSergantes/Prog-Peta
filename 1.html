      Nintendo’s first video game consoles were actually a series of five systems called Color TV-Game, made in partnership with Mitsubishi. The Color TV-Game was sold exclusively in Japan and mostly had several Pong-inspired minigames built into the system. The first model debuted in 1977 as the Color TV-Game 6, named after the fact that it included six minigames.</p>

   <p>Before Nintendo created and patented its D-pad, the Color TV-Game’s unique controller featured turnable dials.</p>

   <p>Competed against: Magnavox Odyssey series, Home Pong, Coleco Telstar series
