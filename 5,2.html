      Nintendo launched the GameCube in Japan on September 14, 2001. In North America, it released three days after the Xbox on November 18, 2001. This sixth generation of consoles gave Nintendo its stiffest market competition yet. Not only did Sony’s wildly popular PlayStation 2 dwarf the GameCube in sales, but it was also bested by Microsoft’s debut console. In total, the GameCube sold 21.7 million units.

Despite the moniker, the system wasn’t actually a true cube, with unequal dimensions that measured 5.9x6.3x4.3 inches. Nintendo eventually released several color variants, but the GameCube debuted in two colors: black and a bold indigo hue--the latter gave the console a toyish look. Its built-in handle also added to its kid-centric aesthetic.

Underneath the chassis, the system used IBM’s PowerPC Gekko CPU clocked at 486MHz. It was capable of delivering 1.9 GFLOPS of power. It was based on a simple RISC architecture, which Nintendo implemented in hopes of winning back third-party developers it had lost with the N64. The system also featured 43MB of RAM and used ATI’s Flipper graphics chip clocked at 162MHz. With it, the GameCube was able to output a 640x480p resolution. The GameCube didn’t feature an internal hard drive, which Microsoft’s competing Xbox offered at the time; it instead relied on memory cards.

While the system was Nintendo’s first console to use optical discs without the need of an add-on device, they were a smaller proprietary format made in partnership with Panasonic. These Game Discs stored up to 1.5GB of data, which were dwarfed by DVDs that offered up to 8.5GB. Piracy concerns continued to be one of the main reasons for the proprietary format. While the comparatively limited storage size wasn’t an issue for many developers, many cross-platform ports had to be compressed or remove features to fit on Game Discs.

Nintendo went with a two-pronged controller design with the GameCube. It offered unique bean-shaped face buttons along with a single Z button near the right trigger. The controller also incorporated force feedback without the need for an external add-on. In 2002, Nintendo released its WaveBird controller, which traded in rumble capabilities for wireless functionality.

          One of the criticisms against the GameCube was that it couldn’t play DVDs, so Panasonic, which worked in partnership with Nintendo to create its GameCube Game Discs, released the Panasonic Q in 2001. The system would allow you to play DVD movies in addition to GameCube games. It was only sold in Japan and was a commercial flop; Panasonic discontinued it in 2003.
